# Project Name
Salary Calculator

## Description
Duration: 14 hours, over a weekend.

I was tasked with making a table, where the user could add a list of employees with the properties (first name, last name, ID, title and salary). Using Jquery, I developed functions to add the listed employee's salaries together and compare it to a set budget. Once the budget ceiling was reached, the display would turn red. In addition to the assignment, I spent some time making the tool look polished in CSS and crafting a reverse progress bar, tied directly to the incoming salary data.
